<p><strong>Rani Pokhari</strong>, also known as Nhu Pukhu (New Pond) in the Newar language, is a historic artificial pond located in the heart of Kathmandu, 
    Nepal. Surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the modern city, Rani Pokhari stands as a serene and sacred landmark that reflects Nepal’s architectural
     elegance, religious significance, and emotional heritage. It is a symbol of love, loss, and devotion deeply rooted in Nepalese history.</p> 
     <p>The history of Rani Pokhari dates back to the 17th century. It was commissioned in 1670 AD by King Pratap Malla in memory of his beloved queen,
         who was heartbroken after the untimely death of their son. To console her, the king had the pond constructed as a symbol of his love and as a 
         spiritual offering. The pond, measuring about 180 meters in length and 140 meters in width, features a central island that houses the beautiful
          white **Balgopaleshwar Temple**, accessible only during major religious occasions such as **Bhai Tika** and **Tihar**.</p> 
          <p>Over the centuries, Rani Pokhari has witnessed the changing tides of Kathmandu’s history—from the rise and fall of kingdoms to
             the modernization of the city. It has served as a public space for religious ceremonies, cultural gatherings, and peaceful reflection.
              The temple within the pond is dedicated to Lord Shiva in his child form, signifying purity and divine protection. Rani Pokhari’s water was
              \ traditionally considered sacred, collected from various holy sites across Nepal.</p> <p>Despite its significance, the pond faced periods of
                 neglect and damage, particularly during the 2015 earthquake, which caused serious structural damage to the temple and surrounding walls. 
                 However, recent restoration efforts by the government and heritage conservationists have revived its original Malla-era architecture using 
                 traditional materials and craftsmanship, reigniting public interest and reverence for the site.</p> 
                 <p>Today, Rani Pokhari remains a cherished
                     part of Kathmandu’s cultural and spiritual identity. Surrounded by bustling roads and urban growth, it continues to offer a tranquil 
                     reminder of Nepal’s rich history and enduring values. As a blend of historical beauty, devotion, and restoration, Rani Pokhari stands as 
                      a testament to the nation’s commitment to preserving its heritage for future generations.</p>
