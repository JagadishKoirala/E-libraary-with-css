<p>Jumla District (जुम्ला जिल्ला) is one of the ten districts of the Karnali province of Nepal. This district has its headquarters in Jumla and covers an area of 2,531 square
     kilometers. According to the latest population census of 2011, it had a total population of 89,427 and 16,936 households. Historically, Jumla has been known as an 
     important center of the Khas Kingdom, which flourished in the region during the 12th to 14th centuries. The Nepali language (Khas language) emerged from this region.
      The historical and cultural significance of Jumla remains unique among Nepalese heritage. Even today, remnants of ancient Khas civilization, including architectural
       and archaeological sites, can be found.Jumla is not just a geographical location but a historical and cultural treasure in Nepal. Expanding on what has already been
        mentioned, let’s dive deeper into its historical roots, linguistic significance, and cultural heritage. The Khas Kingdom & Its Influence
        Jumla was once the center of the powerful Khas Kingdom, which thrived from the 12th to 14th centuries. 
        The Khas rulers expanded their territory across western Nepal and beyond, influencing regions in present-day Tibet and India. This kingdom played a crucial role 
        in shaping the political, linguistic, and cultural history of Nepal.
        
        Sinja Valley, in Jumla, is known as the cradle of the Nepali language, where old Nepali inscriptions and manuscripts have been found.
        Ancient stone inscriptions in Khas language are evidence of its deep historical roots.
        The language spread across Nepal due to migration and political influence.
         Cultural Significance & Traditions
        Jumla’s rich culture is reflected in its festivals, rituals, and lifestyle.
