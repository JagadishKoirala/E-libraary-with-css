<p> <strong>Dharan</strong> is a vibrant sub-metropolitan city located in the eastern part of Nepal, at the foothills of the Mahabharat Range in Sunsari District.
     It holds a unique place in Nepal’s history, serving as a cultural and economic bridge between the hilly and Terai regions of the country. Known for its
      planned layout, greenery, and cultural diversity, Dharan has evolved from a modest settlement into a significant urban center over the past century. </p>
       <p> The history of Dharan dates back to the early 20th century. It was officially established in 1902 during the Rana regime as a trading post to
         facilitate commerce between the hills and the lowlands. However, its transformation began in 1952 with the establishment of the **British Gurkha 
         Recruitment Center**, which significantly influenced the city’s development. Dharan became a hub for military recruitment, especially for youths 
         aspiring to join the British and Indian armies. This brought economic opportunities and exposed the local population to global influences, helping 
         shape Dharan’s modern identity. </p> <p> Another turning point in Dharan’s history was the establishment of **BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences
             (BPKIHS)** in the 1990s, one of Nepal's leading medical universities. This institution brought educational growth and healthcare development, 
             attracting students and professionals from across Nepal and neighboring countries. </p> <p> Culturally, Dharan is known for its harmonious 
                coexistence of diverse communities, including Rai, Limbu, Newar, Brahmin, Chhetri, and others. It has become a melting pot of eastern
                 Nepalese traditions and customs. Religious and cultural landmarks such as the Dantakali Temple, Pindeshwor Temple, and Buddha Subba Shrine
                  are significant both spiritually and historically, attracting thousands of pilgrims and visitors every year. </p> 
                  <p> Despite facing challenges such as urban sprawl and infrastructural demands, Dharan continues to thrive as a center of education, tourism,
                     and multicultural identity. From its roots as a small trading town to its role in modern Nepalese society, Dharan stands as a testament 
                     to adaptability, resilience, and community spirit. </p>
