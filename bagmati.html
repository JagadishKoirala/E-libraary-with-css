<h2 class="page-title">Bagmati River</h2>

    <p>
        The Bagmati River holds a central place in the history and development of Nepal, particularly in the Kathmandu Valley, 
        where some of the earliest settlements of the region emerged. The river is considered one of the oldest and most sacred rivers 
        in Nepal, deeply intertwined with both the spiritual beliefs and socio-cultural evolution of the nation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The origins of the Bagmati trace back to ancient times. It is believed that the Kathmandu Valley was once a large lake, and 
        according to legend, the Bodhisattva Manjushri drained the water by cutting a gorge at Chobhar, allowing civilization to flourish 
        along the fertile banks of the newly formed river system. This transformation paved the way for the establishment of ancient cities 
        like Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur, all of which have prospered due to the river’s presence.
        Throughout Nepalese history, the Bagmati has served not only as a source of water and irrigation but also as a spiritual boundary 
        between the sacred and the secular. It has long been used for religious rituals, cremations, and festivals. The Pashupatinath Temple, 
        one of the holiest Hindu shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva, stands along its banks, symbolizing the river’s sacredness.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the Licchavi (c. 400–750 AD) and Malla (12th–18th centuries) periods, the Bagmati River continued to influence urban planning 
        and temple construction. Many historic structures and ghats (riverfront steps) were built along its course, reflecting the architectural 
        and spiritual development of the time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite its revered status, the river began to suffer from pollution and neglect in the modern era, especially with the rapid urban 
        growth of Kathmandu. Nevertheless, the Bagmati remains a symbol of Nepal’s ancient civilization, and efforts to preserve and restore 
        its sanctity reflect a broader cultural revival and respect for the country's historical roots.
