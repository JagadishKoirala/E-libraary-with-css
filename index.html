    <h2>Welcome To Historical Nepal E-Library</h2>
    <p>
      Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multicultural, multi-religious, and multilingual country. 
      The most spoken language is Nepali, followed by several other ethnic languages. 
      The modern-day Nepal was established in 1768 and started a campaign of unifying what 
      would form the modern territory of Nepal. Some former territories had been lost due to the Anglo-Nepalese War. 
      The Anglo-Nepalese War was a conflict that ended with both victories and losses for the kingdom, ultimately accepting tributary status with the Qing dynasty of China from 1792 to 1856. In a historical vote for the election of the constituent assembly, the government voted to abolish the monarchy in June 2006. Nepal became a federal republic on 28 May 2008 and was formally renamed the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.

        <strong>Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev</strong> (11 June 1920 - 31 January 1972) 
        was the King of Nepal from 1955 until his death in 1972. He was the son of King Tribhuvan 
        and ascended the throne following his father's passing. King Mahendra is best known for his 
        controversial yet transformative rule, during which he abolished Nepal's democratic system 
        and introduced the Panchayat system in 1960, establishing an absolute monarchy. 
        Despite criticism for suppressing democracy, Mahendra worked towards modernizing Nepal, 
        introducing economic reforms, expanding infrastructure, and strengthening Nepal's sovereignty 
        through a non-aligned foreign policy.  His leadership saw the introduction of Nepal's first Five-Year Plan, educational 
        institutions, and industrialization efforts. However, his autocratic rule also led to growing dissatisfaction among democratic 
        activists. King Mahendra passed away on 31 January 1972, after suffering a heart attack, and was succeeded by 
        his son, King Birendra. His legacy remains highly debated, as he is both credited for Nepal's modernization and criticized for
         undermining democracy.

       <strong> Surya Bahadur Thapa</strong> was a distinguished Nepalese politician who played a significant role in the country's political landscape
         over a career spanning more than five decades. Born on March 21, 1928, in Muga, Dhankuta District, Nepal, Thapa's political
          journey was marked by his service as Prime Minister on five separate occasions, serving under three different monarchs. 
          political career began in the late 1950s when he was appointed to the Upper House of Parliament in 1959. He first ascended
           to the position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1963, marking the beginning of his influence in Nepalese politics. 
           He subsequently held the office of Prime Minister during the periods of 1965-1969, 1979-1983, 1997-1998, and 2003-2004.
           the first Prime Minister under the Panchayat system—a party-less political system introduced by King Mahendra—Thapa played 
           a pivotal role in shaping Nepal's governance during that era. His tenure saw various reforms, including efforts to modernize 
           the country's legal and administrative frameworks.Throughout his career, Thapa was known for his adaptability and resilience,
            navigating the complexities of Nepal's shifting political environment.
